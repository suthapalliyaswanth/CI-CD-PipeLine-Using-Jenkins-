**1. Source Code**

Description: The starting point for the pipeline, where the source code is stored.
Tool Used: Likely a Git-based repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Purpose: Developers push changes to the repository, triggering the pipeline.

---
**2. Webhook**

Description: A mechanism that notifies Jenkins when code changes are pushed.
Purpose: It triggers the Jenkins job automatically, starting the pipeline when changes occur in the source code repository.

---
**3. Jenkins**
   
Description: Jenkins is the CI/CD automation server orchestrating the pipeline.
Purpose:
Monitors changes in the source code via the webhook.
Executes the build, test, and deploy processes step-by-step.
Controls flow based on conditions.

---
**4. Maven**
   
Description: A build automation tool that manages dependencies, compiles the code, and builds the project.
Purpose:
Maven packages the code into an artifact (e.g., JAR, WAR file).
If Maven build fails, the pipeline exits and generates a report.

---
**5. SonarQube**

Description: SonarQube is a tool for static code analysis.
Purpose:
Analyzes code quality, bugs, vulnerabilities, and technical debt.
If the code fails SonarQube checks (poor quality or errors), the pipeline exits and generates a report.

---
**6. Tests**

Description: A stage in the pipeline to execute automated tests.
Purpose:
Ensures the build is stable and functional.
If the tests pass, the process continues to push an image to Docker Hub.
If the tests fail, the pipeline exits.

---
**7. Docker Hub**

Description: A cloud-based repository for Docker images.
Purpose:
After a successful build and test phase, Jenkins pushes the applicationâ€™s Docker image to Docker Hub.
This image is used for deployment in Kubernetes.

---
**8. Image Updater**

Description: A component that updates the new image version in a Manifests Repo.
Purpose:
Manifests (e.g., Kubernetes YAML files) are updated with the new Docker image tag.
Ensures the updated version is ready for deployment.

---
**9. Manifests Repo**

Description: A Git repository storing Kubernetes YAML manifests.
Purpose:
Contains configuration files that describe the desired state of the Kubernetes deployment (e.g., pods, services).
Updated by the Image Updater.

---
**10. Argo CD**

Description: A Continuous Delivery tool for Kubernetes.
Purpose:
Monitors changes in the Manifests Repo.
Deploys the updated Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.
Ensures the application state matches the desired configuration.

---
**11. Kubernetes**

Description: An orchestration platform for deploying and managing containerized applications.
Purpose:
Deploys and runs the Docker container (application).
Manages scaling, networking, and availability of the application.

---
**12. Report Generation**

Description: A reporting stage that generates feedback about the pipeline execution.
Tools Used: Integrations with Slack, Email, and Project Management tools.
Purpose:
Notifies teams of success or failure during the pipeline.
Logs build status, errors, and test results for analysis.
